# Movies Extract, Transform, & Load
## *Overview*
"Amazing Prime" was satisfied with the initial dataset we provided for the Hackathon and now wants to update it daily. Britta enlisted us to create an automated pipeline that takes in the data, performs the "transformations," and loads it into our PostgreSQL tables. We've refactored parts of the code to create one function that takes in all 3 necessary files and performs the ETL via the PostgreSQL database.
